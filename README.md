# CNN-Based Analysis of Pressure Maps for Posture and User Classification

This repository contains the code and report for the project "CNN-Based Analysis of Pressure Maps for Posture and User Classification". The project explores convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for simultaneous posture recognition and subject identification using pressure maps from a sensorized mattress.
